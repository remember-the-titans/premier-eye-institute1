 * WHERE THIS GOES: drop this file at `lib/services-journeys.ts`.
 *
 * ⏱ EVERY `duration` VALUE BELOW IS AN EDITABLE PLACEHOLDER.
 * They are typical optometry timings, NOT confirmed Premier Eye Institute facts.
 * Confirm each with the clinic, then edit here. This file is the only place
 * durations live, so changing them here updates every page.
 *
 * ART: each scene's `art` is a local path under /public. The cartoon SVGs are
 * generated (see 03-ASSET-MANIFEST.md) and downloaded into
 * public/services-art/<service>/ by the setup step in the master prompt.
 * `art` is the crisp SVG; `artFallback` is a WebP raster fallback.
